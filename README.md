# Titanic-Survival
RMS Titanic Dataset consists of passenger details who traveled. In this prediction model, we predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the several factors like the passenger's age, class, gender and so on. The Python notebook solution depicts the use of logistic regression with different optimizer and compare the convergence rate.
